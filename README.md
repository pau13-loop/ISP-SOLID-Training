# SIP Java Exercise

> In this repository you'll find **ISP Principle Java Exercise**. This kata is to understand the SIP Principle that belongs to the SOLID Principles that you should follow to make your code cleaner and more readable. In case you don't know about how works this principle or how to apply it correctly below you'll find a link that will explain it and it has some examples where you can get an idea about how to work with this principle precisely and correctly.

## Motivation

The motivation I've found to do this exercise, it's improved my skills working with the SOLID Principles. I know they're really useful like for example, don't be pushed or forced to depend on methods that it does not have any use in the class you're implementing them. If you follow these principles correctly, you can get this goal.

## Reflections

My opinion about this exercise is that, for example, before I've worked with interfaces in my programs, but I've never been forced to make an interface segregation trying to avoid to implement methods in my entities that I don't use. It's really interesting to see how you get this in the simplest way of just splitting your interfaces in the program. I got to understand the big chances that gives you the ISP Principle and how useful can become if you use it properly. The exercise has been quite simple, but it has achieved its function, letting me practice with this principle now I'm just fancying how will be the next program I'll have to make applying all the SOLID Principles correctly and letting me be more fluent and efficient coding.
